Twenty One Pilots
"Stressed Out"

I wish I found some better sounds
No one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice
That sang some better words
I wish I found some chords
In an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme
Every time I sang
I was told when I get older
All my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
